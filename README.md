# pmat - Postman Automation Testing -

Introduction
===

pmat is a javascript library that integrates in a postman collection to automatize regression testing. 

pmat cover the following functionlities:

 * Can be used in postman, runner, newman.
 * Record mode:
   * saves automatically responses from postman executions or iteration runs in runner or newman.
   * Generate default test scripts with description and to validate status and response body.
 * Test mode:
   * Execute test scripts comparing record test data agains current execution.
 * Test cases can be modified manually:
   * Excluding nodes for comparison can be done using easy expressions: country.town.**.date*
   * Description of test cases Nodes can changed
   * Skipping requests to test.
   * Defining these values at general request level or specifically for each particular test case.
* Input data:
   * definition and values of Input data required for each iteration
   * API to save input data for other executions.

Installation
======

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/edf8730443bc0965728b)

* Click to install set up collection in Postman.
* Execute setup request in Postman

Example
======


https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josuamanuel/pmat/master/pmat-globals.js

 pmat can be used in postman, runner and newman. PostmanThis collection is intended as an introduction to pmat tool. pmat tool allows to run regression testing in Postman and Newman of APIs. pmat uses record and test to compare new outputs of an API against a previous execution.**


  * Main postman application: indicated with a variable in globals record	true
  * execution of a collection in runner.
  * newman: execution in newman.

**There are 3 main functionalities**

  * Record output: indicated with a variable in globals record	true
  * Testing: Default behaviour if record is not indicated.
  * save: Allows

Examine the following code

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }
   
An h1 header
======

this is a test

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º



An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
~~~



### An h3 header ###

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local
doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].

[^1]: Footnote text goes here.

Tables can look like this:

size  material      color
----  ------------  ------------
9     leather       brown
10    hemp canvas   natural
11    glass         transparent

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
multi-line tables:

--------  -----------------------
keyword   text
--------  -----------------------
red       Sunsets, apples, and
          other red or reddish
          things.

green     Leaves, grass, frogs
          and other things it's
          not easy being.
--------  -----------------------

A horizontal rule follows.

***

Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.
oranges
  : Citrus!
tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term/definition pair to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block":

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

![example image](https://www.getpostman.com/img/v2/logo-big.svg "An exemplary image")

Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
